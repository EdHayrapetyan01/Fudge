## About the App

Fudge dashboard is an frontend test application written by React, and the main concepts are the quick stats, financial health, performance goals, news, users.

## Technologies

React, sass, chart.js, react router dom, reactstrap for ui, uuid, react-icons etc.

## Approach

I used the camelCase naming style for my css class names and Sans Serif font which is a free alternative from Google that can be used instead of Helvetica.(root parent font of Helvetica)
Entire application didn't pixel perfect because i used adobe xd trial version and it isn't provide all the necessary info. Example (trackers, sidebar, icons) didn't show fully info, like paddings margins between rows, but everything else implemented as needed (width,height etc.) plus created working modals , user rows are scrollable if user data gets to long, also logout which redirected to the landing page, and all other routes from sidebar aren't just blank pages, added "coming soon" little design to make entire app dynamic.All the data are mock as needed. The one issue regarding the design is responsiveness, not have much time for make responsive, but worked only landing page responsiveness
